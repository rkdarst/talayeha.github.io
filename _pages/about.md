I am currently a James S. McDonnell postdoctoral researcher at the Departyment of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University, where I also completed my PhD in December 2017. My doctoral thesis "Temporal Patterns in Human Behavior" can be found [here.](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/28892/isbn9789526077246.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

My interests are interdiciplinary. Most of my research work focuses on analyzing data generated on digital devices (such as smartphones) to understand behavioral patterns of their users. My work is at the intersection of data science, computational social science, and compuatational psychiatry.
